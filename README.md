# PPRiskMagnes for Xamarin.iOS

A Xamarin.iOS binding library for [PPRiskMagnes iOS](https://github.com/braintree/braintree_ios/tree/master/Frameworks/XCFrameworks/PPRiskMagnes.xcframework) library.

## About
This project is maintained by [tuyen-vuduc](https://github.com/tuyen-vuduc).<br>
He has been in software development industry since 2009 as a C#.NET developer and fell in love with Xamarin since 2014. He contributed his first open source library for Xamarin in 2017 when he opened Naxam, his own business.
Since 2019, Naxam is no longer in business, hence his contribution to his libraries is less and less due to his limited time and budget.
<br>
Recently, in the late of 2022, there are requests from his users (libraries's users), he tries to arrange his time to upgrade his libraries in his sparetime and try to bring himself back to be a code-holic person again. 
<br>
In this return, Naxam will no longer be the prefix of his libraries' names. The library's name will be the native name suffixed with `.iOS`
